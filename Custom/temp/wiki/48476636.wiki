|A FEW LETTERS FROM OUR FRIENDS WELL-ROOTED, STOCKY AND HEALTHY [From Mr. F. R. Ferrand of Wil- lows, Glenn County, California.] “In my dealings with you the past two years, I have found your firm courteous, prompt, careful and ab- solutely reliable. The stock I pur- chased from you for myself and neighbors, both deciduous and citrus trees, was of the best grade, well rooted, stocky and healthy. Having bought before from several other nur- series, I have no hesitation in affirm- ing that the stock from your com- pany was the best and received in best condition owing to your careful method of packing.” TRUE TO NAME AND THE SQUARE DEAL [From Mr. J. M. Hampton, mana- ger of the Farmers’ Union of Live Oak, one of the largest growers and shippers of green and dried fruits in Northern California.] “1 take pleasure in recommending the Fresno Nursery Company to be one of the most reiable nursery con- cerns in the State. My ten years of business dealing with them justifies the assertion that you can depend on them every time for a square deal and trees always true to name. The many orchards in this section, where the trees have been bought through me, will bear witness to this fact. During my ten years of deal- ing with your concern 1 cannot re- call of ever hearing of one word of complaint or dissatisfaction.” LONG DISTANCE NO OBJECTION [From Eltweed Pomeroy, orchardist and vineyardist at Donna, Tex.] "For two years I have been getting nursery stock from you and it has been uniformly satisfactory; for in- stance, last year, I planted one plot with 475 Black Hamburgh grape vines and the stock was on the road nearly a month; 470 of those were living when I pruned them this win- ter and they now have from 5 to 20 pounds of grapes on each, though only planted a year ago February. They could not be in their present condition if they had been poor vines or poorly packed for the long trans- port here.” EXCELLENT AND TRUE TO NAME [From Wylie M. Giffin, leading fruit grower in Fresno County.] “I take pleasure in saying that I have bought nursery stock from you for a number of years and have found it at all times of excellent quality and true to name.” HIGHLY REGARDED [From E. A. Walrond, Cashier First National Bank, Fresno.] “It gives us pleasure to state that the Fresno Nursery Company, Incor- porated, of Fresno, California, and its officers, have been well and fav- orably known to this Bank for a number of years, and are highly regarded by us.” R ESULTS are what the world wants these days. Here is a record of the re- sults our nursery stock has made in twelve different orchards. We have scores of other letters similar to these — more than enough to fill this entire booklet alone. If you are in doubt after having read these splendid letters, write and we will send you others — if you are convinced then let us prove that our nur- sery stock will do as much for YOU. EXCELLENT AND TRUE TO LABEL [From Morgan Niles, pioneer handler of nursery stock for thirty years in the Santa Clara Valley.] “During the past ten years I have handled upwards of forty thousand trees from your nursery. This stock was planted by the leading orchard- ists in the Santa Clara Valley, to whom I sold it. The orchards speak for themselves. The stock proved true to label and gave every satis- faction. I will continue to handle your stock and give you the prefer- ence as long as your supply lasts and I continue in business.” EXCELLENT, CLEAN AND HEALTHY [From W. A. Ellwood, resident agent Fireman's Fund Insurance Com- pany of San Francisco.] “As the planting season has ended, I wish to thank you for the courteous treatment received. While dealing with your honorable house for the past two seasons, all nursery stock received has been excellent, clean and healthy and all shipments have been made promptly. With your clean business methods a customer gained is never lost.” STOCK JUST AS REPRESENTED [From R. F. Dunn, prominent or- chardist, Dinuba, Cal.] “After planting different varieties of nursery stock purchased from you each season through a period of years dating back to 1894, I feel that I would not be doing my duty towards you as a business firm (growing and handling a commodity wherein there are so many chances for mistakes) if I did not in some way express to you my appreciation. Throughout these twenty years, during which time I have improved a number of places with vineyards and orchards, I want to say that in every single instance your stock has proven to be just as you represented it. This, added to the fair and courteous treatment met with at all times, makes this letter fall far short of its mark.” A CUSTOMER FOR TWENTY YEARS [From W. B. Nichols, president Din- uba Savings Bank.] “It gives me pleasure to say that I have been doing business with the Fresno Nursery Company and its predecessors, Marshall & Wilson, for something over twenty years, and during that period I have planted something like three hundred and eighty acres of orchard and vineyard, and that most of the stock was pur- chased from them. I am more than glad to testify that during all this time my dealings have been exceed- ingly satisfactory, the stock being true to name, healthy and well grown. “For the last ten or twelve years I have been intimately associated with Mr. F. H. Wilson, president of the Fresno Nursery Company, and have always found him to be a man of integrity and ready at all times to do the fair thing, and also to hold an intimate acquaintance with Mr. Charles A. Chambers, secretary of the Company, hence I feel perfectly free to recommend these gentle- men to the favorable considera- tion of any prospective purchasers of nursery stock. To show that I back this letter with my own money I will state that I am this year purchasing citrus stock for the planting of thirty acres, and all of it is being handled through this Company. I also expect to plant in 1915 ninety acres of cit- rus and deciduous trees and vines, and it is my intention to place my order with this Company.” YOU ARE SAFE WITH THE FRESNO NURSERY CO. [From John C. Jones, fig expert, Merced, Cal.] “I cannot recommend your nur- sery stock too highly. Of the thou- sands of trees and vines I have pur- chased from you, I can say that they were all you claimed them to be — first-class in every respect. I am sure that I have never purchased stock from any other nursery that has given the satisfaction that your stock has. I always feel safe in recommending your nursery stock to prospective planters.” ONE HUNDRED PER CENT GROWTH [From E. H. Sheridan, Orosi Orange Land Co., Orange Cove, Cal.] “I herewith enclose check for lot of trees received from your Fresno Nurseries. The lemon trees bought from you have made a 100 per cent growth, and the others have made almost as good a record. At your convenience, we wish to have you help us make appropriate selection of the trees to be planted the coming season in the block we have dedi- cated for park purposes, opposite the depot, in the new town of Orange Cove.” STOCK AS REPRESENTED [From H. A. Hyde, Berry Specialist, Watsonville, Cal.] “In my business dealings with the Fresno Nursery Co., I have found them courteous and obliging, and their stock all that they represented it to be.”

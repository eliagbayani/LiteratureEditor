Vinegar is poured down the throat, which probably dissolves  these substances in the crop, and thus removes the distention  they had occasioned. The astonishing quantity in the land  puzzles me. I know of no insect sufficiently abundant to pro-  duce them in such vast quantity. The ant and the musquito  are the only insects whose number bears any proportion to these  little substances." With the musquito they are of course in no way connected ;  but I have every reason to believe that the animal is placed  by a merciful Providence in the dry colonies, as a parasite to  keep down the numbers of those little invincible and voracious  creatures the ants, which would otherwise swarm in countless  myriads uninjured by the rains which thin their ranks in the  mountainous and more rainy islands. They occur plentifully  in the Bahamas ; and, under the name of ant-eggs, are strung  into necklaces and ornamental purses by the ladies. In the  rainy climate of St. Vincent they have not been found ; but in  the smaller islands of the Government, which, from the absence  of gigantic mountain ranges, are subject to continued drought,  these bodies are met with in abundance. On a late visit to the  Union Island I collected a boxfull ; and suspecting that others  had failed in tracing the animals to maturity from improperly  placing them in too dry a situation, I brought them home in  moist marl, and had soon the satisfaction to observe the insects  which are here figured issuing from the pearls. I lament to say,  that from the distance of this island, it may be a long time before  I am able to obtain an animal so delicate and small in its state  of ovum and larva ; or have an opportunity of observing them  in coitu, to ascertain whether there be any apparent difference  in the structure of the sexes. I met with them most plentifully in marly soil about stones, under

RESEARCH SUMMARY The Budworm Modeling System is a system of computer programs useful to simulate many aspects of budworm dynamics and budworm-caused damage on stand growth. The Budworm Dynamics Model predicts budworm population changes, foliage growth, budworm growth, feeding, and subsequent defoliation dependent on several site, stand, foliage, and weather conditions. A stochastic weather model is used to estimate weather. Measurements of budworm populations, current defoliation, and routine stand examina- tion data comprise the input data. The Budworm Dynamics Model simulates budworm population dynamics on up to thirty stands at a time. Adult dispersal is simulated between stands. Because the model does not estimate tree growth, its use is limited to making short-term (up to 15 years) projections. The Prognosis-Budworm Dynamics Model \s a combination of the Budworm Dynamics Model and the Prognosis Model. The Prognosis Model contains tree growth models and is used to estimate stand growth and development. It represents one stand at a time for long-term (about 100 to 300 years) projec- tions. A set of damage models adjusts tree growth, mortality, and top damage to account for budworm-caused defoliation. The Prognosis-Budworm Dynamics Model can be used to make long-term projections of population dynamics, defoliation, and their effects on growth and yield. Another, smaller, combination of system components is called the Prognosis-Budworm Damage Model. It is a com- bination of the Prognosis Model and the budworm damage components. Estimates of budworm-caused defoliation may be entered directly into this program bypassing the need to run the more complex and expensive dynamics model. This user's guide describes how to use these computer programs. The scientific basis and behavior of the programs are not included.

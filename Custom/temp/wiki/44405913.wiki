|BISECTIONS TO CORRESPONDENTS. Much trouble, delay, and disappointment, may be avoided by  observing the following directions : 1st. Be particular to write your name distinctly* with Post Office,  County, and State: orders are frequently received without even a  signature. 2d. Write out your orders legibly, in a list apart from the body  of the letter, and specify if any varieties may be substituted when  not on hand. Amateurs not conversant with the varieties, will not  suffer by leaving the selection to us, as we will, in such cases, make  the best possible selection. 3d. It is requested that explicit directions be given for marking  and shipping packages. Where no specific directions are given, we  shall use our best judgment as to the route and mode of conveyance;  it should, however, be expressly understood, that all packages are at  the risk of the purchasers after their delivery to the forwarders. 4fh. All orders from unknown correspondents, must be accom-  panied by cash, a draft, or P. 0. order, or instructions to Collect on  Delivery by Express. 5th Purchasers are requested to notify us promptly of any errors  which may have occurred in filling their orders, as our desire is to  give entire satisfaction. 6th. For information as to mailing of Seeds, see page 8. In conclusion, we would state that the usual care will be observed  inputting up all orders, large or small, to give full satisfaction to  the purchaser, in the quality of the article, as well as m the manner  of packing and forwarding.

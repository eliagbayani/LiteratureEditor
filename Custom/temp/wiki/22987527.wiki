|PREFACE. Upwards of four tliousand works on horses and their  utilization have been published^ and of this number about  one half have been printed in Great Britain. It may  therefore appear an act of presumption on the part of any  writer to augment the already lengthy list, but recently  new animals_, such as Prejevalski's horse and Grevy^s  zebra^ have been discovered; species hitherto untamed  have been pressed into the service of man, and new  hybrids have been reared which hold out the promise of  great utility. Much knowledge has been gained by recent travellers  respecting the history and habits of species hitherto  imperfectly known, and, above all, a vast amount of in-  formation has been accumulated, proving the advantages  that are found to arise from utilizing the mule in almost  all civilized countries excepting England, in which country  no book on this useful hybrid has ever been published.  To supply this deficiency ; to demonstrate the great value  and economy of the mule as a beast of draught and  burden, that could be as advantageously employed in this  country in agricultural and general draught purposes as it  is by other nations, and by ourselves in all military  operations abroad, is in part the object with which this  work is published.
